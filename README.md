##A python script to help me practice my spanish. 

I put spanish words as keys in the dictionaries and the meaning in english as values.

I then put all keys in a list so that I only see the spanish words. I also import the random module which shuffles the list of keys every time I start the game. 

The for loop allows me to go through all the words within the dictionary and if the inputted answer matches the value of the key, it lets me know and if the answer is incorrect tells me the correct answer. I then tally the words I got correct and those I got wrong which are displayed at the end.

This is all in a while loop which stays true as long as my response is yes allowing me to repeat the game.
