A python script to help practice my spanish. 

I put spanish words as keys in the dictionaries and the meaning in english as values.

To make the game more efficient. I made an txt file where I put more words and phrases. I then wrote a function which reads through each line and separates the words into key/value pairs and puts them into a dictionary.

I then put all keys in a list so that I only see the spanish words. I also import the random module which shuffles the list of keys every time I start the game. 

The for loop allows me to go through all the words within the dictionary and if the inputted answer matches the value of the key, it lets me know and if the answer is incorrect tells me the correct answer. I then tally the words I got correct and those I got wrong which are displayed at the end.

This is all in a while loop which stays true as long as my response is yes allowing me to repeat the game. 

I also took into account case sensitivity by formatting the words to accept any input from the user.
